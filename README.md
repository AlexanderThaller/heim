heim project is a handy Rust tool for receiving various system information.
It targets to have at least the same functionality as
[psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil),
[gopsutil](https://github.com/shirou/gopsutil) or
[oshi](https://github.com/oshi/oshi) eventually.

## Platform support

At the moment it is in MVP phase, so probably feature you need is still missing.

Check out [Github projects page](https://github.com/heim-rs/heim/projects)
